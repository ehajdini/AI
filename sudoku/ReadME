Encode the Sudoku puzzle as Constraint Satisfaction Problem using the Z3 language fragment. 


1. Typical Sudoku constraints:
(a) Numbers cannot be repeated in any row, column, or 3x3 square
(b) Cells whose values are already specified must be assigned to the respective
values.
2. Top middle 3x3 square: The numbers must comply with the arithmetic expressions drawn in the figure:
(a) ⟨3,0⟩+⟨3,1⟩+⟨3,2⟩=15
(b) ⟨4,1⟩−⟨4,0⟩=2
(c) ⟨4,2⟩/⟨5,2⟩ = 2
3. Top right 3x3 square: at most one of the yellow cells may contain a value larger than 4.
4. Center square: 
The sum of the corners of the center square must be equal to twice the center cell of the center square. 
In other words: ⟨3, 3⟩ + ⟨5, 3⟩ + ⟨3, 5⟩ + ⟨5, 5⟩ = 2 × ⟨4, 4⟩
5. Middle right square: Numbers must comply with the inequalities. In particular: 
(a) ⟨6,3⟩ < ⟨7,3⟩ < ⟨8,3⟩
(b) ⟨6,4⟩ < ⟨7,4⟩ < ⟨8,4⟩
(c) ⟨6,5⟩ < ⟨7,5⟩ < ⟨8,5⟩
6. Bottom left square: For every cell in this square with x = 1, one of the horizontally adjacent cells must equal the value minus 1. 
For example, for the cell ⟨1,6⟩, if ⟨1,6⟩ = 4, then either ⟨0,6⟩ = 3 or ⟨2,6⟩ = 3.
7. Bottom middle square: The values of the orange cells must be either all odd or all even. Similarly for the blue cells. Moreover, if the orange cells contain odd numbers, then the blue cells must contain even numbers. 
If the orange cells contain even numbers, then the blue cells must contain odd numbers.
