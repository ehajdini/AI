Model the two-player version of Snake Game in GDL (Game Description Language)

There are two players: red and blue. Each player controls a snake on a 9-by-9 grid. 
In each game step, every player needs to move its snake forward to a cell adjacent to the current position of the snake’s head. 
While moving, the snake eats objects that may be located at the new position of the snake’s head. 
There are two kinds of objects: Coins, when eaten, increase the points of the respective player by 3. 
Apples, when eaten, increase the points of the respective player by 1, and extend the tail of snake by one cell. 
While apples are consumed by the snakes (are removed from the board after being eaten), coins can be eaten arbitrarily often (remain on the board after being eaten). 
Moving the snake to a cell is only possible if that cell does not contain a wall. 
When the snake of player x moves onto a cell which holds this snake or the other snake, then x dies. 
If red dies, then blue obtains 10 additional points. Vice versa, if blue dies, then red obtains 10 additional points. 
(If both die, i.e., if they run into each other, both get the additional 10 points.) 
The game ends when either player died, but after 40 steps at the latest. The player who got most points wins.
