Prove that if the following three statements hold, then ∀x∃y : r(x, y), for x, y, z ∈ Z. 1. ∀x∃y : p(x, y)
2. ∀x∃y : q(x, y)
3. ∀x∀y:[(p(x,y)∨q(x,y)) =⇒ ∀z:[(p(y,z)∨q(y,z)) =⇒ r(x,z)]]

Ex 4 (related files: ex4.log ex4.z3)
There are four gardens that cultivate different kinds of flowers (rose, tulip, and lily), veg- etables (onion, carrot, and pepper), and fruits (apple, banana, and cherry).
Given that we know the facts given in the list below, use Z3 to prove that there must be (a) a lily in garden1, (b) a fruit in gardens 2 and 3 (the same kind of fruit in both), and (c) tulips and roses are in the same garden. Formulate each of the facts (1.-10.) and the statements to be proved (a-c) as a separate statement in Z3. 
Write all statements in general form (i.e. without referring to particular objects), unless the description refers to particular objects.
1. Any plant is either a fruit, a flower, or a vegetable.
2. Everybody grows exactly 3 different plants.
3. Every plant is in at least one garden.
4. Exactly one garden has all 3 kinds of fruits.
5. Exactly 3 plants are in 2 or more gardens and they are one vegetable and two fruits. All others plants are in a single garden.
6. There is no garden that grows both rose and carrots.
7. Any garden with tulip has another flower.
8. Garden1 has one fruit, one vegetable and one flower.
9. Garden2 has no flowers.
10. Gardens 1 and 4 have carrots and Garden3 has bananas.
